# Categorical and mixed data clustering
##Introduction
The aim of the project is to replicate paper 'Extensions to the k-Means Algorithm for Clustering Large Data Sets with Categorical Values' (see the reporitory). In the paper, the authors decsribes clustering of categirical data and suggest a new method for clustering data of mixed type - i.e. data with both categorical and numerical variables. In out project, we aim to replicate the clustering analysis. We write our own two functions replicating the two algorithms described in the paper - 'kmodes' (clustering of only categorical data) and 'kproto' (clustering of mixed type data). Consequently, we use these two functions on two datasets used by the authors. Next, we compare our results of clustering with the results from the paper.
